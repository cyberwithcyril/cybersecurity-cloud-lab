# Cybersecurity Cloud Lab

This repository contains my personal cloud lab projects, notes, and scripts related to cybersecurity, cloud platforms, and vulnerability management.

## Lab Overview

The lab covers:

- Azure virtual machines and security configurations  
- VMware VM templates and network setups  
- Tenable vulnerability scanning configurations and reports  
- Automation scripts for scanning and remediation  
- Notes and documentation on cloud security best practices

---

## Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Azure VMs are scalable computing resources offered by Microsoft Azure cloud. In this lab, I work with Azure VMs to:

- Deploy and configure Windows and Linux virtual machines for testing security scenarios  
- Apply network security groups (NSGs) and firewall rules to control traffic and limit exposure  
- Use Azure CLI and PowerShell to automate VM provisioning and security compliance  
- Perform vulnerability scanning and remediation on Azure VMs using Tenable integration  
- Explore identity and access management (IAM) best practices and role-based access control (RBAC)  
- Simulate attack scenarios such as brute force, privilege escalation, and patch management  

This hands-on experience helps deepen understanding of cloud infrastructure security, automation, and compliance.

## Tenable Vulnerability Management

Tenable is a leading vulnerability management platform used to identify, assess, and remediate security weaknesses across IT assets.

In this lab, I utilize Tenable tools to:

- Conduct vulnerability scans across Windows and Linux environments, including Azure VMs and on-premises hosts  
- Configure scan policies for compliance frameworks such as DISA STIG, PCI-DSS, and NIST standards  
- Analyze vulnerability reports to prioritize remediation based on CVSS scores and business risk  
- Automate remediation workflows using PowerShell and scripting to address critical vulnerabilities  
- Integrate Tenable with security information and event management (SIEM) systems for continuous monitoring  
- Practice risk management frameworks (RMF) to align vulnerability findings with organizational policies  

Mastering Tenable enhances skills in proactive security assessment and effective vulnerability lifecycle management.
